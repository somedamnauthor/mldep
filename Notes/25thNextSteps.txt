Templatize the model code into 3 functions - 
- Model definition 
- Preprocessing
- Predict

Model class called into the wrapper script 
- Invokes these functions within a flask app
- Trigger on POST request

Dockerfile
- Use python base image, add the wrapper, code
- Installs torch
- starts app


Next Steps:
- Use OpenWhisk for functions
- Final objective is to take configs from YAML, use a script to turn that into a set of deployments
- Libvirt for VMs

Meet Monday 1:45

Track metrics for each of the 3 operations from the wrapper side
